title: "Handwriting Style Extraction Project"
excerpt: "A project for extracting handwriting style from images

- With our OCR-based pipeline, we successfully collected tens of thousands of word-level
annotated images, enriching the existing handwriting dataset.

- With the LSTM-based style encoder, the modified HiGAN+ model successfully generated
realistic handwriting images with desired calligraphic styles.
