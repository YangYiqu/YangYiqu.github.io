title: "Front-end project"
excerpt: "- I am responsible for the development of a web-based interactive and interpretable visual interface for AI audio generation, designed to provide a user-friendly interface for the review and inspection of speech waveforms and spectrograms, and to show the clip probability at each point of the audio.

- In this project, I gained extensive experience in web interface development and became proficient in the Flask framework. By integrating front-end and back-end technologies, I successfully created a powerful and user-friendly interface.

- By delving into the realm of audio processing, I successfully applied this knowledge to interface development, ensuring the accuracy of audio data and optimizing its visualization effects.

Key features of the project include:
1. File Upload: Users can upload multiple audio files in various formats.
2. Segmentation Probability: The web page calculates and displays the probability of segmentation for each uploaded audio file.
3. Waveform and wave spectrogram Visualization: The waveform of each audio file is visualized, allowing users to see the audio'samplitude over time.
4. Time Point Segmentation Probability: The segmentation probabilities at different time points within each audio file are visualized, enabling users to identify potential boundaries.
5. User Interaction: The web page provides an interactive interface where users can zoom in/out on the waveform and hover over time points to see corresponding segmentation probabilities.
   
This project aims to assist users in analyzing audio data by providing insights into potential segmentation points and their probabilities. It offers a user-friendly and interactive platform for exploring and understanding audio content.
