title: "Front-end project"
excerpt: "- I am responsible for the development of a web-based interactive and interpretable visual interface for AI audio generation, designed to provide a user-friendly interface for the review and inspection of speech waveforms and spectrograms, and to show the clip probability at each point of the audio.

- In this project, I gained extensive experience in web interface development and became proficient in the Flask framework. By integrating front-end and back-end technologies, I successfully created a powerful and user-friendly interface.

- By delving into the realm of audio processing, I successfully applied this knowledge to interface development, ensuring the accuracy of audio data and optimizing its visualization effects.
