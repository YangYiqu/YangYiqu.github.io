title: "Sony Internship-LLM/AI"
excerpt: "- I actively participated in the algorithm development for the COSCO Shipping intelligent scheduling project and closely monitored the business requirements. Utilizing a path generation and optimization approach, I successfully designed an interactive algorithm that provided efficient and accurate scheduling results for the pulp ship transportation business. Additionally, I wrote a detailed documentation explaining the algorithm and its implementation (***Click the title to get more info.***). 

- This experience enhanced my ability to apply theoretical models to complex practical problems and improved my project communication and collaboration skills.<br/><img src='/images/智能排期业务模型图.png'>"
