title: "Sony Internship-LLM/AI"
excerpt: "- I have participated in and been responsible for implementing the feeding task instructions for a robot based on the Large Language Models (LLMs).

- My responsibility included completing Prompt Engineering, which involved designing the ReAct framework. This framework enables LLMs to interact with external tools to obtain additional information and generate inference paths and task-specific operations in an interleaved manner. By decomposing language instructions, I aimed to provide more reliable and practical responses.

- To achieve this, I utilized Grounded-Segment-Anything to implement the localization of specific objects in two-dimensional images and performed three-dimensional reconstruction of the coordinates. I further encapsulated these functions into an API."
